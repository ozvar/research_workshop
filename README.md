# Tools and Knowledge to Detect Statistical Oddities in Published Research

This repository houses the content presented at a workshop on research evaluation at the IGGI Conference 2019. 

The aim of this workshop is to introduce knowledge and tools that may help researchers better evaluate the accuracy of reported statistics - both in their own as well as in published research. A secondary aim is to cover concepts that may help researchers avoid the statistical issues illuminated in the workshop.
