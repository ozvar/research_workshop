# Tools and Knowledge to Detect Statistical Oddities in Published Research

This repository houses the content presented at a workshop on research evaluation at the IGGI Conference 2019. 

The aim of this workshop is to introduce knowledge and tools that may help researchers better evaluate the accuracy of reported statistics - both in their own as well as in published research. A secondary aim is to cover concepts that may help researchers avoid the statistical issues illuminated in the workshop.

## Simulations
This sections aims to illustrate the inter-relation between statistical power, statistical significance, sample size and effect size through a series of simulations.  
  
 Each simulation can be performed employing the relative function contained in `statistical_power.py`, or a series of experiments can be scheduled through the simulations manager located in `AI_reserch_police.py`.

## Requirements
We recommend setting up a virtual environment to avoid any dependency conflicts as shown below:
``` python
# Pipenv is a virtual environment manager
pip install pipenv

# Create a virtual environment in this directory
pipenv install

# open / activate virtual environment
pipenv shell
# Now we are good to go....
```
